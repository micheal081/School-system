E-LEARNING SYSTEM API
The E-learning System API is a powerful Node.js-based server application that enables seamless integration between e-learning platforms and software applications. It provides standardized methods for course management, user interaction, and access to educational resources. By leveraging this API, educational institutions and learners can benefit from automated workflows, personalized learning experiences, and improved online learning outcomes.

Technology Stack
Node.js Express.js MongoDB Mongoose

Getting Started
To get started with the E-learning System API, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and MongoDB on your machine.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the root directory:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   MONGO_URI=<Your_Mongo_URI_here>
   PORT=<Port_number>
   ```

5. Start the server by running the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the API endpoints using the following base URL:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/v1/elearning
   ```

API Endpoints
The E-learning System API provides the following API endpoints:

1. Courses Routes
   - GET /courses - Get a list of all courses.
   - GET /courses/:courseId - Get details of a specific course.
   - POST /courses - Create a new course.
   - PUT /courses/:courseId - Update an existing course.
   - DELETE /courses/:courseId - Delete a course.

2. Lessons Routes
   - GET /courses/:courseId/lessons - Get all lessons of a specific course.
   - GET /courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId - Get details of a specific lesson.
   - POST /courses/:courseId/lessons - Create a new lesson for a course.
   - PUT /courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId - Update an existing lesson.
   - DELETE /courses/:courseId/lessons/:lessonId - Delete a lesson.

3. Users Routes
   - POST /users/register - Register a new user.
   - POST /users/login - Authenticate and login a user.
   - GET /users/profile - Get the profile information of the authenticated user.
   - PUT /users/profile - Update the profile information of the authenticated user.
   - POST /users/enroll/:courseId - Enroll the authenticated user in a course.
   - POST /users/unenroll/:courseId - Unenroll the authenticated user from a course.

4. Enrollments Routes
   - GET /enrollments - Get a list of all enrollments.
   - GET /enrollments/:enrollmentId - Get details of a specific enrollment.
   - PUT /enrollments/:enrollmentId - Update an existing enrollment.
   - DELETE /enrollments/:enrollmentId - Delete an enrollment.

Usage
To utilize the E-learning System API, you can send HTTP requests to the respective API endpoints using a client such as Postman or by using an HTTP library in your preferred programming language.

Controller Functions
The API routes are handled by functions defined in separate controller files. These controller functions contain the necessary logic to handle each API request and generate appropriate responses.

Middleware Functions
Middleware functions, such as authentication middleware, can be used in the routes to ensure the authentication and authorization of users accessing protected resources. These functions verify the presence of valid authentication tokens, validate them, and grant access accordingly.

By implementing the E-learning System API, educational institutions and learners can unlock the full potential of online education, providing an enhanced learning experience, efficient course management, and seamless integration with other software applications.
